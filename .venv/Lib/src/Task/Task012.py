'''An API sometimes fails due to network delays.
Write a program to retry the API call 3 times until the response code becomes 200.
If it still fails after 3 tries, print a failure message.
Expected Output Example:

Attempt 1: Response 500

Attempt 2: Response 200

✅ Test Passed'''

response_code=int(input("Enter response code: "))
if response_code == 200:
    print("Test Passed")
while response_code != 200 and i<=3:
    i=i+1
print("Test Failed")
